Open a scratch terminal buffer in a new window. Destroy or recreate that
terminal with a command. These terminal commands accept all arguments
available to Vim |terminal|.

                                                *ScratchTerm*
:ScratchTerm            Open a terminal in Vim. The only difference between a
                        terminal opened with `:ScratchTerm` and a terminal
                        opened with `:term` is that the "scratch" terminal is
                        marked with a buffer-local variable "scratch_term".

                                                *ScratchTermV*
:ScratchTermV           Open a scratch terminal in a vertical split.

                                                *ScratchTermUnfocused*
:ScratchTermUnfocused   Open a scratch terminal but keep focus in current
                        window.

                                                *ScratchTermUnfocused*
:ScratchTermUnfocusedV  Open a vertical scratch terminal but keep focus in
                        the current window.

                                                *ScratchTermReplaceF*
:ScratchTermReplaceF    Kill all open scratch terminals on the current tab and
                        replace with a single, focused scratch terminal.

                                                *ScratchTermReplaceFV*
:ScratchTermReplaceFV   Kill all open scratch terminals on the current tab and
                        replace with a single, vertical, focused scratch
                        terminal.

                                                *ScratchTermReplaceU*
:ScratchTermReplaceU    Kill all open scratch terminals on the current tab and
                        replace with a single scratch terminal. Keep focus in
                        the current window.

                                                *ScratchTermReplaceUV*
:ScratchTermReplaceUV   Kill all open scratch terminals on the current tab and
                        replace with a single, vertical scratch terminal. Keep
                        focus in the current window.

                                                *ScratchTermsKill*
:ScratchTermsKill       Kill all open scratch terminals on the current tab.

                                                *ScratchTermsClose*
:ScratchTermsClose      Close all open scratch terminals on the current tab.
                        The difference between this and `ScratchTermsKill` is
                        that, if a process is running in the scratch terminal,
                        you will see the usual warnings: "E948: Job still
                        running (add !  to end the job)" or "E89: No write
                        since last change for buffer [n] (add ! to override)"
                        depending on what type of buffer you were in when you
                        called the function.
